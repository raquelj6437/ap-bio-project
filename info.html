        <p id="intro">The Cell Cycle goes through a process of cell division call mitosis. Mitosis is a type of cell division in which one cell, the mother, divides to produce two new cells, the daughters, that are genetically identical to itself. Mitosis is the part
            of the division process in which the DNA of the cell's nucleus is split into two equal sets of chromosomes. Meiosis, on the other hand, is used for just one purpose in the human body. Its goal is to make daughter cells with exactly half as
            many chromosomes as the starting cell.</p>

                            <p>In <b>early prophase</b>, the cell starts to break down some structures and build others up, setting the stage for division of the chromosomes.
                                <br> <br> The chromosomes start to condens which make them easier to pull apart later on.
                                <br><br> During the this process, the <b>mitotic spindle</b> begins to form. The spindle is a structure made of microtubules, strong fibers that are part of the cell’s “skeleton.” Its job is to organize the chromosomes
                                and move them around during mitosis. The spindle grows between the centrosomes as they move apart.
                                <br><br> The <b>nucleolus</b>, a part of the nucleus where ribosomes are made, disappears. This is a sign that the nucleus is getting ready to break down.

                            <p>In <b>late prophase</b>, sometimes also called prometaphase, the mitotic spindle begins to capture and organize the chromosomes.
                                <br><br> The chromosomes finish condensing, so they are very compact.
                                <br><br> The mitotic spindle grows more, and some of the microtubules start to “capture” chromosomes.
                                <br><br> The nuclear envelope breaks down, releasing the chromosomes.

                            <p>Microtubules that bind a chromosome are called <b>kinetochore microtubules</b>. Microtubules that don’t bind to kinetochores can grab on to microtubules from the opposite pole, stabilizing the spindle. More microtubules extend
                                from each centrosome towards the edge of the cell, forming a structure called the <b>aster</b>.</p>

                <h3>2. Metaphase</h3>
                <p>
                    In <b>metaphase</b>, the spindle has captured all the chromosomes and lined them up at the middle of the cell, ready to divide.
                    <br><br> During this phase, all the chromosomes align at the metaphase plate. (This is not an actual plate. It is just a term used where the chromosomes line up.)
                    <br><br> At this stage, the two kinetochores of each chromosome should be attached to microtubules from opposite spindle poles.
                    <br><br> Before proceeding to anaphase, the cell will check to make sure that all the chromosomes are at the metaphase plate with their kinetochores correctly attached to microtubules. This is called the <b>spindle checkpoint</b> and
                    helps ensure that the sister chromatids will split evenly between the two daughter cells when they separate in the next step. If a chromosome is not properly aligned or attached, the cell will halt division until the problem is fixed.

                <h3>3. Anaphase</h3>
                <p>
                    In <b>anaphase</b>, the sister chromatids separate from each other and are pulled towards opposite ends of the cell.
                    <br><br> The protein “glue” that holds the sister chromatids together is broken down, allowing them to separate. Each is now its own chromosome. The chromosomes of each pair are pulled towards opposite ends of the cell.
                    <br><br> Microtubules not attached to chromosomes elongate and push apart, separating the poles and making the cell longer.
                    <br><br> All of these processes are driven by <b>motor proteins</b>, molecular machines that can “walk” along microtubule tracks and carry a cargo. In mitosis, motor proteins carry chromosomes or other microtubules as they walk.

                <p>
                    In <b>telophase</b>, the cell is nearly done dividing, and it starts to re-establish its normal structures as cytokinesis (division of the cell contents) takes place.
                    <br><br> The mitotic spindle is broken down into its building blocks.
                    <br><br> Two new nuclei form, one for each set of chromosomes. Nuclear membranes and nucleoli reappear.
                    <br><br> The chromosomes begin to decondense and return to their “stringy” form.
